Description: As a project for CS599 Unsupervised Learning, I built this package
             of simple unsupervised learning algorithms. Specifically, this
             package provides a simple implementation of principal component
             analysis to perform dimensionality reduction and a simple
             implementation of dynamic programming to perform changepoint
             detection. Note, while these algorithms work, they are more limited
             in options and less efficient than those algoirthms found in other,
             more proffessional packages.
